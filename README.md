# ubuntusetup
script i used when setting up new ubuntu vms on mediatemple. It's a bit old, but should be a good guideline

It does the basics. Updates itself, installs the dev tools, snmp, apache2, openssl, php, etc.
Sets up users in both the OS and MySQL, and does an initial configure of iptables.

The astute will see this is a modification of an older script that was aimed at centos
